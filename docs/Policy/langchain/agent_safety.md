# Policy Rationale: LangChain Agent Safety

**Policy ID:** `langchain_agent_safety`
**File:** `langchain/agent_safety.yaml`
**Rules:** LC-101, LC-102, LC-111
**Severities:** critical, low, low
**Fix types:** code, config, config
**References:** LLM06 (Excessive Agency), LLM10 (Unbounded Consumption)

## What this policy covers

Agent-scope rules for the constructor-shaped LangChain / LangGraph agents Trustabl
discovers: `create_react_agent` and `create_agent` (normalized class `ReactAgent` /
`CreateAgent`) and the legacy `AgentExecutor`. The rules cover the two highest-signal
agent-level risks: wiring a code-execution/shell built-in tool (LC-101) and a
tool-calling loop with no explicit iteration cap (LC-102 / LC-111).

The raw `StateGraph` graph agent is a documented discovery gap — its tools and model
are assembled across many call sites, so it is not yet modeled as a single agent.

## Rule-by-rule defense

### LC-101 — Agent wires a code-execution or shell built-in tool (Severity: critical, Confidence: 0.85, Fix type: code)

**What we detect:** a LangChain agent (`ReactAgent` / `CreateAgent` / `AgentExecutor`)
whose resolved tool set includes `PythonREPLTool`, `PythonAstREPLTool`, or
`ShellTool` (predicate `agent_uses_hosted_tool_class`). Discovery recognizes these
built-ins when they appear in the agent's tool list — including the common
positional form, `create_react_agent(model, [PythonREPLTool()])` — and records them
as hosted-tool edges.

**Why it is flaggable:** these built-ins execute code or shell commands chosen by
the model. Once one is on the tool surface, a prompt injection or a confused model
has a direct path to arbitrary execution in the agent process. PythonREPLTool and
ShellTool have been the concrete vector in multiple published LangChain RCE
advisories — this is excessive agency (LLM06) in its most literal form: the agent is
granted the ability to run anything.

**Real-world consequence:** an agent built to "answer questions about a CSV" is
given a `PythonREPLTool`; a crafted question makes it run `__import__('os').system(...)`
and read the deployment's secrets.

**Severity critical:** the capability is the defect — wiring an unsandboxed
PythonREPL or ShellTool directly to a model-driven agent is arbitrary code
execution by design; the fix is to remove the built-in or sandbox-and-gate it.
Rated critical so the deployment-readiness gate's critical-override blocks the
agent rather than averaging the single fatal tool away across cleaner surfaces. **Confidence 0.85:** a few agents legitimately need a REPL and
have sandboxed it out of band, which the class-name match cannot see.

### LC-102 — AgentExecutor has no explicit max_iterations limit (Severity: low, Confidence: 0.6, Fix type: config)

**What we detect:** an `AgentExecutor` with no effective `max_iterations` kwarg
(predicate `agent_kwarg_missing`).

**Why it is flaggable:** with no explicit `max_iterations`, the executor falls back
to LangChain's default of 15 — a generic ceiling, not one sized to this task. A
model that loops or oscillates still runs up to 15 tool round-trips (LLM10,
Unbounded Consumption), a cost the workflow may not tolerate, and the implicit cap
can shift between versions; when the looped tools have side effects it is a
correctness concern too.

**Severity low:** the framework default (15) already prevents a true runaway, so
this flags a missing *explicit, task-sized* cap — a hygiene nudge, not a defect.
**Confidence 0.6:** an executor relying on the default, wrapped by an external
timeout, or guarded by a custom loop is over-flagged.

### LC-111 — TypeScript AgentExecutor has no explicit maxIterations limit (Severity: low, Confidence: 0.6, Fix type: config)

**What we detect:** a TS `AgentExecutor` with no effective `maxIterations` kwarg.

**Why it is flaggable / consequence:** identical to LC-102 in LangChain.js.

**Severity low / Confidence 0.6:** same profile as LC-102.

## What this policy does not cover

The raw `StateGraph` agent (discovery gap), the `Requests*` SSRF built-ins (recorded
as hosted edges but not yet a dedicated agent rule), v1 `create_agent` middleware
quality, and whether a code-execution tool is *actually* sandboxed out of band. The
iteration rules check `AgentExecutor` only — `create_react_agent` / `create_agent`
enforce their own recursion limit differently and are out of scope here.

---

## Recommendations beyond the fix

Remove REPL/shell built-ins from production agents; if code execution is required,
run it in an isolated sandbox and gate it behind a human-in-the-loop approval (a
LangGraph `interrupt_before` breakpoint or a tool-approval middleware). Set
`max_iterations` / `maxIterations` (and a `max_execution_time`) sized to the task,
and set `handle_parsing_errors` so a malformed model step surfaces rather than
retrying forever.
